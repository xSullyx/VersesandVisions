Delilah

In ancient lands of tales enshrined,
A story unfolds, both bold and divine.
Samson, a man of strength untold,
His fate bound in the strands of stories old.

Delilah, with eyes like stars so bright,
A weaver of schemes, veiled in the night.
In the realm of love where power's sway,
Their destinies entwined, in a biblical play.

Samson, a warrior with locks of might,
Delilah's gaze, a tempting sight.
She wove her web, a seductive snare,
A game of secrets, in the Philistine lair.

In her arms, Samson's strength did wane,
His power lost, in love's mystic chain.
A weave of whispers, a perilous dance,
In the tapestry of fate, they took a chance.

Yet, in the end, with strength regained,
Samson's destiny, once more ordained.
A tale of love, betrayal, and might,
In the echoes of time, a biblical light.
